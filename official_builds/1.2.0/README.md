Version:
1.2.0

----------------------------------------------
LiveSplit Version Tested:
1.7.6

----------------------------------------------
Notes:

- Added the ability to save the SGL window position and size, just be sure to save the layout.

- Fixed a bug where it was possible for the SGL window would crash and not be handled in a race condition... The component shouldn't cause LiveSplit to crash/hang.
